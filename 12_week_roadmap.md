# High-Performance, Large-Scale ML Systems

## Weeks 1-2: Basics of ML Algorithms and Scalability Study:

Focus on understanding the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms. Explore linear regression, decision trees, SVMs, neural networks, and deep learning basics.

Projects: Implement basic ML algorithms from scratch in Python. Use datasets from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Resources: Courses: Coursera's "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng, fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders. Books: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

## Weeks 3-4: Distributed Computing and Big Data Technologies Study:

Learn about big data ecosystems, focusing on Hadoop and Spark. Understand MapReduce, Spark RDDs, and DataFrames.

Projects: Build a simple big data project using Spark. For example, a log analysis tool or a recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset.

Resources: Courses: Udemy’s "Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python - Hands On!"

Books: "Learning Spark: Lightning-Fast Data Analytics" by Jules S. Damji, Brooke Wenig, Tathagata Das, and Denny Lee. "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann for theoretical understanding.

# GPUs and Kubernetes

## Weeks 5-6: GPU Programming Basics Study:

Learn about CUDA, GPU architecture, and how GPUs are leveraged in ML tasks.

Projects: Implement simple vector and matrix operations using CUDA. Experiment with optimizing a small neural network using GPUs.

Resources: NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Documentation. Online tutorials and courses on GPU programming.

## Weeks 7-8: Kubernetes Fundamentals Study:

Understand Kubernetes architecture, pods, deployments, services, and volumes.

Projects: Deploy a multi-container application using Kubernetes. Start with something simple like a web app with a database backend.

Resources: Kubernetes Official Documentation. Online courses like "Kubernetes for Beginners" on Udemy or the Kubernetes learning path on Pluralsight.

# PyTorch and OS Internals

### Weeks 9-11: Learning PyTorch Study:

&nbsp;

Begin with PyTorch basics, tensors, and autograd. Progress to building simple neural networks, and then explore CNNs and RNNs.

Projects: Develop a classification project using PyTorch (e.g., image classification with CNNs, text classification with RNNs).

Resources: PyTorch Official Tutorials. "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann.

### Weeks 12-13: Operating System Internals Study:

Focus on memory management, process scheduling, inter-process communication, and file systems.

Projects: Write a simple memory allocator in C or build a basic shell to understand process management.

Resources: “Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces” by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau. Online resources like the OSDev Community for practical understanding.
