# Understand Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statiscal method used to model relationships between a dependeatn variable and a independent variable (or more than one). The aim is to find a relationship that best fits the data

### Simple Linear Regression 

In simple linear regression, models the relationship between two variables. The equation is:

$$y = mx + b$$

- $$y$$ is the dependent variable (what we're trying to predict)
- $$x$$ is the independent variable (he predictor)
- $$m$$ is the slope of th eline (how much $$y$$ changes for the unit change in x)
- $$b$$ is the y-intercept (the value of $$y$$ whe $$x$$ = 0 )

### Multiple Linear Regression

In multiple linear regression this is extended to multiple independent variables:

$$y=b 
0
​
 +b 
1
​
 x 
1
​
 +b 
2
​
 x 
2
​
 +...+b 
n
​
 x 
n
​
