# Understand Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statiscal method used to model relationships between a dependeatn variable and a independent variable (or more than one). The aim is to find a relationship that best fits the data

### Simple Linear Regression 

In simple linear regression, models the relationship between two variables. The equation is:

$$y = mx + b$$

- \( y \) is the dependent variable (what we're trying to predict).
- \( x \) is the independent variable (the predictor).
- \( m \) is the slope of the line (how much \( y \) changes for a unit change in \( x \)).
- \( b \) is the y-intercept (the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \)).


### Multiple Linear Regression

In multiple linear regression this is extended to multiple independent variables:

$$
y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n
$$

- \( y \) is still the dependent variable.
- \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) are the independent variables.
- \( b_0 \) is the y-intercept, and \( b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \) are coefficients for each independent variable.
